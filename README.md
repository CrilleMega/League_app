# League tracker (The name is WIP, don't worry)
This app is designed to keep track of scores in local game store tournaments.
This software is specifically targeted towards Magic the gathering, but you may
modify it for use in any other game. I mean, it's open-source afterall.

I hope that it comes to good use for any organisation, store, or playgroup that decides to give it a try.
