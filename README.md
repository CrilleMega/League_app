# Scoreboard tracker designed for MTG

This app is designed to keep track of scores in local game store tournaments.
This software is specifically targeted towards Magic the gathering, but you may
modify it for use in any other game. I mean, it's open-source afterall.

This program is originally an improvement of an old scoreboard i made, a few weeks ago I looked back at my old source code and I could not believe how awful it was. So I decided to redeem myself and write it again but in actually good code (subjective).

I hope that it comes to good use for any organisation, store, or playgroup that decides to give it a try.

The application is unfortunately designed for windows only.
